The accused, a drug dealer named Edward Bartlett, was present at the scene and had been involved in an altercation with Ana's partner, Ezra Verhoesen. Evidence suggests that Bartlett arrived under the mistaken impression that Ezra and Ana had contacted him for his services and demanded compensation when asked to leave. A physical confrontation ensued, during which Ezra was rendered unconscious. It is estimated that Ana passed away sometime after Ezra lost consciousness. Partygoers, unaware of the events that had taken place, contacted emergency sercices as soon as they realized Ana was not breathing.",

No weapon was recovered from the scene, but the characteristics of the injury indicate it was caused by a tool with a concentrated point of impact, such as a hammer, mallet, or a similarly shaped instrument.",

The fracture lines associated with the right-side impact dissipate into those from the left, indicating that the left-side impact likely occurred first. We cannot determine the exact time between these two impacts, only their relative sequence if they occurred around the same time."

This helps confirm that the injury occurred in the vicinity of where the blood was found. The analysis also ruled out the presence of any foreign blood from other individuals at the scene, supporting the conclusion that Ana was the primary victim of the attack.",

Kiernan had been reported absent from work and was not at home around the time of Jacob's death. Furthermore, Kiernan's car was discovered near the lake where the body was found.
